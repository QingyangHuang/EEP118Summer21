MLR3 holds as there is variation in all our variables, and no perfect collinearity (__R__ would have tossed out a variable if there was perfect collinearity). MLR4 is the bigger concern; if we omitted a variable that is both correlated with a child's Z-score and the education level of the mother or income, then the expected value of the error conditional on the $x$'s would be nonzero, and our assumption would be violated.
