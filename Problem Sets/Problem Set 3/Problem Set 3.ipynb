    "# Exercise 1. The Value of Environmental Services\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is based on the paper [Does Hazardous Waste Matter? Evidence from the Housing Market and the Superfund Program (Greenstone and Gallagher 2008)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/123/3/951/1928203?redirectedFrom=fulltext). This paper explores individualsâ€™ willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental quality by observing the impact of increasing environmental quality on housing prices. This method is known as __hedonic valuation__, whereby the price of a good is determined by each of its attributes. In the case of a house, its value is determined by all of its physical characteristics (e.g., number of bedrooms) as well as the characteristics of the neighborhood in which it is located (including environmental quality). For this paper, the change in environmental quality results from the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. The study focuses on Superfund sites, areas designated by the US government as contaminated by hazardous waste and that pose a hazard to environmental/human health . The EPA placed certain Superfund sites on the National Priorities List (NPL), which meant that these sites were legally required to undergo remediation. If individuals value environmental quality, then housing prices should increase after nearby NPL sites are cleaned up. To determine the extent to which individuals value the cleanup, we can compare housing close to a hazardous waste site that was cleaned up to homes near a similar waste site that was not cleaned up.\n"

    "The dataset for this paper is saved to the ProblemSet3 folder as `Greenstone_Gallagher_PS3.dta`. The data include observations on 450 census tracts that are within 2 miles of a hazardous waste site. This includes census tracts where the site in question was on the NPL, and thus was legally required to be cleaned up, as well as those that were not on the NPL. The dataset posted on bcourses contains the following variables for each census tract for the year 2000:\n",
    "* $fips$: FIPS census tract identifier\n",
    "* $npl$: indicator for whether the site in a given census tract was placed on the NPL (=1 if site is on NPL, =0 otherwise)\n",
    "* $lnmdvalhs$: log median housing value\n",
    "* $owner\\_occupied$: % of housing that is owner occupied\n",
