    "Measuring greenhouse gas emissions and understanding how economic activity affects these levels can be a\n",
    "difficult task. For example, greenhouse gases vary in the amount of time they remain in the atmosphere and\n",
    "how much energy they absorb. To address this issue, total greenhouse gas emissions are often measured in\n",
    "units of Global Warming Potential (GWP). GWP is also known as $CO_2$ equivalents; $CO_2$ is given a GWP of 1\n",
    "and all values less than/greater than 1 convey how many times less/more global warming potential the gas has\n",
    "relative to $CO_2$. For example, while methane ($CH_4$) has a shorter lifespan than $CO_2$ it absorbs much more\n",
    "energy, so it is considerably more harmful and is given a GWP of 28-36. In this problem set we will explore\n",
    "how two measures of economic activity, GDP per capita and renewable energy consumption, are correlated\n",
    "with greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from the World Bankâ€™s Development Indicators for 2012, which are provided for you (*World_Bank_Indicators.csv*). Here\n",
    "we focus on three variables. First is total greenhouse gas emissions, which include $CO_2$, all anthropogenic\n",
    "sources of methane ($CH_4$), nitrous oxide ($N_2O$) and F-gases. The total emissions per capita in a given country\n",
    "are calculated as metric tons of $CO_2$ equivalents divided by the midyear population. Next is GDP per capita,\n",
    "calculated as gross domestic product divided by midyear population and measured in thousands of US dollars.\n",
    "Lastly, renewable energy consumption is the share of renewables in total final energy consumption. The figures\n",
    "below plot data from all 123 countries contained in the original dataset (the provided dataset is a subset of this original data). The values for selected countries can be found in Tables 1, 2, and 3."
